      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "title": "What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained",
      "body": "HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users can create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth nothing that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality.\n\nHTML has a lot of use cases, namely:\n\nWeb development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. \nInternet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. \nWeb documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.\nIt’s also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. \n\nThis article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.\nThe average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.\n\nHTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.\n\nAll HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. \n\nThe three main parts of an element are: \n\nOpening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <p> to create a paragraph. \nContent – this is the output that other users see. \nClosing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example, </p> to end a paragraph. \nThe combination of these three parts will create an HTML element:\n\n<p>This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.</p>\nAnother critical part of an HTML element is its attribute, which has two sections – a name and attribute value. The name identifies the additional information that a user wants to add, while the attribute value gives further specifications. \n\nFor example, a style element adding the color purple and the font-family verdana will look like this:\n\n<p style=\"color:purple;font-family:verdana\">This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.</p>\nAnother attribute, the HTML class, is most important for development and programming. The class attribute adds style information that can work on different elements with the same class value. \n\nFor example, we will use the same style for a heading <h1> and a paragraph <p>. The style includes background color, text color, border, margin, and padding, under the class .important. To achieve the same style between <h1> and <p>, add class=”important” after each start tag: \n\n<html>\n<head>\n<style>\n.important {\n  background-color: blue;\n  color: white;\n  border: 2px solid black;\n  margin: 2px;\n  padding: 2px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1 class=\"important\">This is a heading</h1>\n<p class=\"important\">This is a paragraph.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\nMost elements have an opening and a closing tag, but some elements do not need closing tags to work, such as empty elements. These elements do not use an end tag because they do not have content:\n\n<img src=\"/\" alt=\"Image\">\nThis image tag has two attributes – an src attribute, the image path, and an alt attribute, the descriptive text. However, it does not have content nor an end tag. \n\nLastly, every HTML document must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration to inform the web browser about the document type. With HTML5, the doctype HTML public declaration will be:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\nMost Used HTML Tags and HTML Elements\nCurrently, there are 142 HTML tags available that allow for the creation of various elements. Even though modern browsers no longer support some of these tags, learning all the different elements available is still beneficial. \n\nThis section will discuss the most-used HTML tags and two main elements – block-level elements and inline elements. \n\nBlock-Level Elements\nA block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the document. For example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element.\n\nEvery HTML page uses these three tags:\n\n<html> tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document.\n<head> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.\n<body> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- META INFORMATION -->  \n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <!-- PAGE CONTENT -->\n  </body>\n</html>\nOther popular block-level tags include:\n\nHeading tags – these range from <h1> to <h6>, where heading h1 is largest in size, getting smaller as they move up to h6. \nParagraph tags – are all enclosed by using the <p> tag.\nList tags – have different variations. Use the <ol> tag for an ordered list, and use <ul> for an unordered list. Then, enclose individual list items using the <li> tag. \nInline Elements\nAn inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and emphasized strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the flow of the content. \n\nFor example, a <strong> tag would render an element in bold, whereas the <em> tag would show it in italics. Hyperlinks are also inline elements that use an <a> tag and an href attribute to indicate the link’s destination:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com/\">Click me!</a>\nHTML Evolution – What Differs Between HTML and HTML5?\nThe first version of HTML consisted of 18 tags. Since then, each new version came with new tags and attributes added to the markup. The most significant upgrade of the language so far was the introduction of HTML5 in 2014. \n\nThe main difference between HTML and HTML5 is that HTML5 supports new kinds of form controls. HTML5 also introduced several semantic tags that clearly describe the content, such as <article>, <header>, and <footer>. \n\nPros and Cons of HTML\nJust like any other computer language, HTML has its strengths and limitations. Here are the pros and cons of HTML:\n\nPros:\n\nBeginner-friendly. HTML has a clean and consistent markup, as well as a shallow learning curve.\nSupport. The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind it.\nAccessible. It is open-source and completely free. HTML runs natively in all web browsers.\nFlexible. HTML is easily integrable with backend languages such as PHP and Node.js.\nCons:\n\nStatic. The language is primarily used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP.\nSeparate HTML page. Users have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the elements are the same. \nBrowser compatibility. Some browsers adopt new features slowly. Sometimes older browsers don’t always render newer tags.\nHow Are HTML, CSS, and Javascript Related\nHTML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create the vast majority of website content. \n\nCSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations. On the other hand, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries. These three languages are the fundamentals of front-end development.\n\nUnderstanding HTML and Improving Your HTML Knowledge\nLearning about HTML is a great first step for those interested in web development. \n\nThere are plenty of courses available online to learn to code, but we have listed three of the best tutorial databases for HTML:\n\nW3Schools – has resources, examples, and exercises to help learn basic HTML for free. There is also a self-paced HTML tutorial that costs $95 and provides an official certificate. \nCodecademy – offers introductory courses for free with interactive tutorials.

There is exclusive content available for $19.99/month.\nCoursera – offers various courses that provide in-depth explanations with real-life examples. The subscription price is $49/month, and there is a 7-day free trial to start. \nConclusion\nHTML is the primary markup language found on the internet. Every HTML page has a series of elements that create the content structure of a web page or application. \n\nHTML is a beginner-friendly language with plenty of support and is mainly used for static website pages. HTML works best together with CSS for the styling and JavaScript for the functionality.
